* The Underground States of Notzork is an homage to Zork I: The Great underground empire,
a text adventure game published by Infocom, Inc in 1981. The concept of a boarded up white
house, a letter in a mailbox, a sprawling underground maze and a grue that will stalk you
in the dark all come from that game.
